# Activity 3. Object Matching
## Instructions:
1. Signal Identification:
Based on everything seen in class, you must identify the necessary signals for the challenge using any
type of computer vision algorithm. You can use techniques such as masks, contours, SIFT, ORB, MSE,
RMSE, among others.
2. Process Documentation:
In a document, you should list step by step what you did to identify the objects. You can include some
lines of code for better visualization and understanding.
## Example:
1. Created an object that contains all the images.
2. Obtained the gradient of each object and sorted them from highest to lowest.
3. Submission:
- Document: A document detailing the process. 20%
- Functional Code: The code used for object identification. 40%
- Video: A video showing the system in operation. 40%
4. Submission Platform:
<p>All materials (process documentation, code, and video of the system functioning) must be uploaded to
GitHub for evaluation.</p>
